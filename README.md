# Exercise List App

 The Exercise List App consumes data from the custom exercises public API. The application retrieves this data and presents it in a list view.

- npm start to start application

## Stories:

- Given an API endpoint which will return JSON, parse this and present as a list of exercises
on screen.
- As part of this list, an image should be shown for each exercise as well as the
exercise title.
- In the JSON, each exercise contains both a male and a female image - the user should be
able to toggle between genders on screen, which will update the images used.
- Selecting each exercise will then show information about this exercise.
